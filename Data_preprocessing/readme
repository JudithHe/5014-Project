The dataset we used is extracted from TPC-H benchmark. We transform the tbl files downloaded from TPC-H benchmark into csv files. Then we performed data preprocessing using pandas library on Google Colab(data_preprocessing.ipynb). We considered 4 csv files (nation.csv, customer.csv, orders.csv, lineitem.csv). 
For each of the csv file, we divided the data into 4 parts equally. We added 2 tags on each row. One is for identifying the DataStream it belongs to (25%, 25%~50%, 50%~75%, 75%~100%). The other is for identifying the table it belongs to (nation, customer, orders, lineitem). 
We concatenated the data from 4 different tables into one data frame. Hence, we have 4 data frames(data25, data50, data75, data 100). The data frame “dataX” contains X% data from each of the 4 tables. For example, the data frame “data25” contains 25% data from each of the 4 tables. Then we shuffle the data in each of the 4 data frames. After that, we exported the csv files for Google Colab.
